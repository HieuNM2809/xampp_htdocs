<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use (as applicable, the “Terms”), available at <a href="https://terms-of-use.openjsf.org">https://terms-of-use.openjsf.org</a>.  In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” includes references to “personal data” as defined under applicable laws.

You do not have to provide us your personal information. However, if you choose not to disclose certain information, we will not be able to provide you with access to certain services or features, including account registration, event registration, training and certification programs, or participation in certain aspects of our open source projects.</p>
